# Embedded Projects

## Purpose of repository 
This repository houses the embedded projects I have worked on while in college

## Notable Projects

### 1)JTT Bluetooth Arcade Controller
The JTT Arcade Controller is a versatile gaming device that caters to the userâ€™s own preferences. With various LED configurations the consumer is able to switch between different modes that best suits their mood or game. The JTT Arcade Controller also does not limit its range with a wired connection. Instead, it is Bluetooth compatible, allowing the user to play within a 50ft range of their PC. More importantly, the user is not restricted to just one gaming platform as the Bluetooth interface makes it simple to map individual buttons on the arcade controller to keys on the PC

### 2) Buck-Converter Control System
A buck converter was designed that could effectively step down the voltage at its input, depending on the duty cycle of the system. The converter was able to produce accurate output voltages at varying input voltages
and duty cycles. Additionally, a regulator was made out of the buck converter in order for the circuit to be able to account for disturbances. This system used a feedback loop and was effective at maintaining the output of the converter at a user defined value.

### 3) Milestone 2-Temperature Control Circuit
For this project, the temperature of a five volt regulator is measured and input into a closed loop temperature control circuit. Using the temperature measurement, the system is able to control the speed of a fan which in turn controls the temperature of the five volt regulator. Through UART communication ports, the user is able to enter a desired temperature and the closed loop system adjusts and sustains the desired temperature.
