# Programming Projects-Tomas Uribe Tobon

## Purpose of repository 
This repository houses the projects that I have completed over the years.


## Notable Projects

### 1)Cookbook App
The Cookbook App is intended to allow the user to search for dozens of different recipes. By requesting recipes from an API (forkify-api) the Cookbook app is able to process the users request and display the available recipes on the UI. The user is able to like/favorite the recipes of their choice which they then can access via a favorites menu. The user can also adjust the serving size of their recipe which then can be added to their shopping list. All persistent data, i.e. the favorites and shopping lists, are saved in local storage in order to be restored upon a page reload. This project was completed in JavaScript (NOTE: HTML, CSS, and API code was provided by course instructor)

### 2)Budget App
The Budget App is intended to allow the user to keep track of their expenses. The user inputs their income and expenses for the month and the app keeps track of each of the respective totals. The app is also able to remove entries to allow for a more robust interface. The application is capable of calculating the total expense to income percentage as well as the indivdual expense to income percentages. Additionally, the expenses are sorted in descending order so the user is always able to see their highest expenses on the top of the list. This project was completed in JavaScript (NOTE: HTML and CSS code was provided by course instructor)

### 3) Zodiac Signs App
The Zodiac Signs App allows the user to input their birthday and the app returns the user's corresponding zodiac sign. Additionally, the user receives a short biography of their zodiac sign. The app is also capable of catching invalid entries in order to provide a more robust experience to the user. This project was completed in Java.

### 4) JTT Bluetooth Arcade Controller
The JTT Arcade Controller is a versatile gaming device that caters to the userâ€™s own preferences. With various LED configurations, the consumer is able to switch between different modes that best suits their mood or game. It is Bluetooth compatible, allowing the user to play within a 50ft range of their PC. The Bluetooth interface makes it simple to map individual buttons on the arcade controller to keys on the PC in order to play multiple different games. This project was completed in C
