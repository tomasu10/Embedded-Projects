# Programming Projects-Tomas Uribe Tobon

## Purpose of repository 
This repository houses the projects that I have completed over the years.


## Notable Projects

### 1)Budget App
The Budget App is intended to allow the user to keep track of their expenses. The user inputs their income and expenses for the month and the app keeps track of each of the respective totals. The app is also able to remove entries to allow for a more robust interface. The application is capable of calculating the total expense to income percentage as well as the indivdual expense to income percentages. Additionally, the expenses are sorted in descending order so the user is always able to see their highest expenses on the top of the list. This project was completed in JavaScript (NOTE: HTML and CSS code was provided by course instructor)

The app is also capable of catching invalid entries in order to provide a more robust experience to the user. This project was completed in Java.

### 3) JTT Bluetooth Arcade Controller
The JTT Arcade Controller is a versatile gaming device that caters to the userâ€™s own preferences. With various LED configurations, the consumer is able to switch between different modes that best suits their mood or game. It is Bluetooth compatible, allowing the user to play within a 50ft range of their PC. The Bluetooth interface makes it simple to map individual buttons on the arcade controller to keys on the PC in order to play multiple different games. This project was completed in C
